### Project Description
LORE: Your one-stop app for exploring the world‚Äôs weirdest folklore, tastiest dishes, and most bizarre traditions. From fire-breathing dragons to fire-breathing chili peppers, we‚Äôve got it all. Why travel when you can snack on knowledge and feast on legends from your couch? Warning: May cause wanderlust and hunger simultaneously!!!

### The Problem statement
Ever walked into a new place and felt like you accidentally wandered onto a movie set without a script? No idea about the culture, no clue about the local food, and the internet‚Äôs giving you less help than a silent GPS? Yeah, we've all¬†been¬†there.

### The Solution
A website which is a treasure trove of intriguing stories, customs, and beliefs from around the world.
