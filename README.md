### Project Description
LORE: Your one-stop app for exploring the world‚Äôs weirdest folklore, and most bizarre traditions. From fire-breathing dragons to fire-breathing chili peppers, we‚Äôve got it all. Why travel when you can snack on knowledge and feast on legends from your couch? Warning: May cause wanderlust and adrenaline rush simultaneously!!!

### The Problem statement
Many cultural stories and folklore remain fragmented and inaccessible, limiting global understanding and appreciation. There‚Äôs a need for a centralized, user-friendly platform to preserve and share diverse folklore from around the world.
### The Solution
A website that is a treasure trove of intriguing stories, customs, and beliefs from around the world.
